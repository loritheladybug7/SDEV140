<h1>RollMaster: Dice-Flinging Delight</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
This is my final project for SDEV 140. The program will allow the user to select various quantities and types of polyhedral dice, 
and ‘roll’ them for a random number. The primary requirements for the project are to use tkinter, a modular approach, and at least 
two windows. There are a handful of other requirements, that specify what widgets and how many of each are required.

<h3>Challenges:</h3>
This is my second program using tkinter, so there has been a huge learning curve. Creating the second
window proved to be one of my biggest challenges, but I'm currently working on ironing out the input validation and error messages. The current version gives the proper error message for the spinboxes and if a non-integer is entered for the custom sides, but otherwise has issues.
If I have extra time, I also want to make the images more uniform in appearance but it isn't a high priority.


<h3>How to Install and Run the Project:</h3>
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install RollMaster.



<H3>How to Use the Project:</H3>
<p>Use it for fun! The goal is to have an easy way to roll dice when it isn't physically possible to do so. On the initial screen, enter the 
  quantities you would like to roll. You can choose between 0 and 50 of any kind of die. You can also set a custom die with any number of sides, 
  and roll up to 50 of it as well.When ready, click ‘Roll’ and your results will be displayed in a new window. ‘Reset’ clears all input on the 
  screen, and ‘Quit’ closes the program.</p>
